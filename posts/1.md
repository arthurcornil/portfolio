# The Man Who Dreamed in an Unknown Language

In the 1950s, a six-year-old boy started having dreams about a man he had never met. This man was teaching him a language the boy couldn’t understand. Sounds unbelievable, doesn’t it? What if I told you this mysterious language turned out to be real? This is the incredible true story of Marc Liblin, the man who dreamed in an unknown language.

## The Dreams

In 1981, Marc Liblin, a 33-year-old Frenchman, had been experiencing these intriguing dreams repeatedly since the age of six. An old man was teaching him a language he had never encountered. While Marc couldn’t understand the sentences he was being taught, he could remember them and speak them out loud the next morning.

This phenomenon is known as _xenoglossy_, the rare occurrence in which a person can speak a foreign language they could not have naturally learned.

Marc was certain he had been learning a *real* language for all these years. He knew that somewhere, people must speak this mysterious tongue. Finding answers became his top priority.

He believed that moving to Brittany might help; there, he could ask sailors and travelers if they had ever heard of this language. To his surprise, this approach worked. One day, in a bar, a man recognized the language. Even more astonishingly, this man knew a woman who spoke it too.

## The Woman Who Knew the Unknown Language

After some hesitation, Marc decided to meet this woman. Her name was Merituini. Shortly after their meeting, Marc began speaking the language from his dreams. To his amazement, Merituini understood him and was able to translate what he had been taught in his dreams.

The language Marc had been learning was **Old Rapa**, spoken on Rapa Iti, a remote island in the Pacific Ocean with a population of around 500 people.

Rapa Iti (Small Rapa) is often considered the smaller sister of Rapa Nui (Big Rapa), better known as Easter Island. Even more intriguingly, the Old Rapa Marc spoke had largely been replaced by **Reo Rapa**, a more modern dialect of the language.

Who would have thought that a Frenchman could learn an ancient language from one of the most remote islands on Earth, inhabited by only around 500 people? Marc was likely wondering the same. But he was determined to find answers.

## Rapa Iti

Marc fell in love with Merituini. Hoping to find answers to his questions, he moved with her to her home island. Marc became absolutely passionate about the history of the island and its people, as though he himself was connected to it.

Marc also had an astonishing intuition. He could find hidden objects he had no way of knowing were there, describe past events that had occurred in places he visited, and sometimes even predict future events. These unbelievable occurrences were reported and verified by different sources, none of whom had discussed the subject with each other beforehand.

I know what you might be thinking: “Another story about supposed miracles…” But Marc wasn’t just claiming to have premonitory dreams. He talked about them to only a few close people, and his predictions turned out to be accurate — even after his death.

Marc didn’t write much about what he came to understand through his quest, as he believed it was sacred knowledge that could not be shared — a sacred secret. However, from some of his conversations with friends and texts he left behind, we can assume the following:

Marc felt that Rapa Iti was a special place — almost like a center of the world, or a gateway to something larger. He felt that in this place, the boundary between imagination and reality was blurred, sometimes even non-existent. He seemed to think similarly about time, as if past, present, and future were blending together. He also thought the language he had been learning in his dreams was somehow linked to this.

When first I read about this, I couldn’t help but think of the Heptapod language from the movie *Arrival*. The Heptapods’ unique language enables them to perceive time differently, allowing them to predict the future.

## The Language of Dreams

Marc’s dreams raise some really interesting questions about the nature of dreaming itself. Were his dreams actually out-of-body experiences (OBEs)? It’s a fascinating possibility. After all, OBEs are often described as experiences where a person feels like they’re floating outside their own body, observing the world from a different perspective. Could Marc have been in some kind of altered state, connecting with the language on a deeper, almost spiritual level? It’s hard to say for sure, but what if these dreams were more than just subconscious wanderings? What if they were something we don’t fully understand yet, a way for Marc’s mind to access hidden knowledge?

It’s wild to think about how much we still don’t know about dreams. We all have them, but we really don’t know why or how they happen in the first place. Some believe dreams are just the brain processing memories or emotions, but others think they might be more than that — like gateways to other realms of consciousness. Maybe Marc’s experience with dreams and language is pointing to something we’ve barely scratched the surface of. Maybe we’re all missing something about how dreams work and what they could really mean for us.

This is just the entry point of the rabbit hole. This article barely begins to uncover the depth, mystery, and intrigue of the full story. Éric Viennot, a French game designer, stumbled upon this story one day, and he was so captivated by it that he decided to conduct his own research.

The result is an absolutely fascinating narrative, shared in the book *L’homme qui rêvait dans une langue inconnue*. If this story has piqued your curiosity, I highly recommend getting your hands on it.
